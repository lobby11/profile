## About me
I build beautiful, interactive web experiences ‚Äî mostly frontend-first projects with a mix of backend features. I enjoy learning new stacks fast, contributing to open-source, and turning ideas into products. I‚Äôve built hobby projects, clones, and small full-stack apps (Node/Express + JS/React) and participate in daily frontend challenges.

## Tech stack (high level)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (simple REST, small servers)  
- **Databases / Tools:** (projects suggest static/JS-based projects; add DBs used)  
- **Dev tools:** npm, Git, VS Code, basic CI/deploy concepts

> Many of my projects are frontend HTML/CSS/JS and React starters; I also explore LLM-based experiments and small Node servers. Examples: `restaurent-llm-chatbot`, `react-start`, `best-movie`, and more. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Selected projects
- **restaurent-llm-chatbot** ‚Äî small LLM-enabled chatbot prototype (Node/Express + static UI). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **react-start** ‚Äî React starter/experiments. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **100DAYS_OF_100WEBPROJECTS** ‚Äî daily frontend mini-projects (HTML/CSS/JS). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

*(I keep experimenting ‚Äî many repos are forks or learning projects. If you want, I can highlight 3 portfolio projects and add short screenshots / live demo links.)*

Thanks for visiting! ‚≠êÔ∏è  
(If you want, I can: 1) tailor this README to emphasize backend (Node + JWT + Mongo) or frontend (React + animations), 2) generate social preview images/screenshots for the top 3 projects, or 3) create commit-ready PR content.)
